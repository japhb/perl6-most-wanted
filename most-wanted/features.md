= Most wanted features

These are features of Perl 6 (either core functionality or in the setting)
that are in high demand by authors.  Some of them are prerequisites to
building or porting most-wanted modules, and some of them are needed for
everyday programming tasks.


== Core features

* Unsigned sized native types
* Diamond role composition


== Misc OS support

* Proper signal handling


== Performance and scalability

* Good base performance (at least not much slower than Perl 5)
* Async socket and file IO
* poll() in addition to non-blocking sockets
* Solid native or hybrid threads
