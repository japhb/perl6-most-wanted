# Most Wanted Features

These are features of Perl 6 (either core functionality or in the setting)
that are in high demand by authors.  Some of them are prerequisites to
building or porting [most-wanted modules](modules.md), and some of them are
needed for everyday programming tasks.


## Core features

* Unsigned sized native types
* Diamond role composition


## Performance and scalability

* Good base performance (at least not much slower than Perl 5)
* Async socket and file IO
* `poll()` in addition to non-blocking sockets
* Solid native or hybrid threads
